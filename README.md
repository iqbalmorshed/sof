SGA - String Graph Assembler (With SOF algorithm)
=================================================

SGA is a de novo genome assembler based on the concept of string graphs. The major goal of SGA is to be very memory efficient, which is achieved by using a compressed representation of DNA sequence reads.

In this repo, we have added SOF algorithm as a subprogram in the SGA pipeline for constructing string graph.
